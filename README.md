## This is my configuration for the VIM editor, version 8+

It relies on the *vundle* plugin manager. To install:
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Then copy the *.vimrc* file in this directory to your home-folder:
```
cp .vimrc ~
```

Start vim and use the command:
```
:PluginInstall
```

Afterwards, everything should be set up.
